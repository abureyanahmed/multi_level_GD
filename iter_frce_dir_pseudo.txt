Iterative force directed algorithm:
  Input: A graph G with labels and label sizes
  Output: A drawing D of G
  While there is an edge not drawn in G
    Take an edge e that is connected to the graph of edges that are currently drawn
    Let e=(u, v) and u is in the current drawing D and v is not drawn yet
    Note that both u and v can not be already drawn since G is a tree
    Let u has |N_u| neighbors in D
    Divide the region around u into |N_u| angular regions based on the drawing
    Draw e in the largest region and scale the drawing of e and label of v so that they don't overlap or cross with other labels or edges respectively
    Note that we can also put e in a position based on the graph topology: that will be helpful when we visualize the whole graph
    Let r be the center of D: r has the minimum eccentricity
    Consider all the nodes in descending order based on the distance from r
      Let w be the current node that has not cosidered earliear and has the maximum distance from r
      Compute the attraction and repulsion for w
      Put larger weight while computing the repulsive force of w from v since we need space for v
      Let the current position of w is p and new position is p'
      If w is not equal to v:
        If moving w from p to p' does not introduce any crossing or overlap, just put w in p'
        Otherwise run a 2d binary search to find a suitable position
      Else:
        If the current label size of v is equal to required label size:
          If moving v from p to p' does not introduce any crossing or overlap, just put v in p'
          Otherwise run a 2d binary search to find a suitable position
        Else:
          Run a 2d binary search to find position: in every available position run a binary search on label size
      Here, to compute the corssing and overlap we can just simpley cosider all edges and vertices
      However, for future we shoule use some structure like quad tree to minimize computation
    For every vertex check the difference between p and p', if the maximum difference is very small and v achived the required label size, terminate
    Otherwise go back to line 13
